## Usage

### Running Migrations

From the backend directory:
```bash
cd database && alembic upgrade head && cd ..
```

Or use the startup script which handles this automatically:
```bash
./startup.sh
```

### Creating New Migrations

From the database directory:
```bash
cd database
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Description of changes"
```

### Running Database Tests

From the project root:
```bash
cd tests

# Core database validation
python test_database_schemas.py        # Schema validation (6/6 tests)
python test_database_sql.py            # SQL DDL validation
python test_database_repositories.py   # Repository testing (4/4 suites)

# Integration and audit tests
python test_database_integration.py    # End-to-end workflows (4/4 tests)
python test_backend_database_audit.py  # Backend audit (5/5 tests)
```
